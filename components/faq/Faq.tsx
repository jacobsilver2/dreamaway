      <h3>RESERVATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        The Dream Away Lodge accepts dinner reservations through Resy. We do not
        accept reservations for the music room. If you are a party of three or
        more, and wish to see the live music, we recommend arriving at least 45
        minutes prior. Seats in the music room are offered on a first come-first
        serve basis so please ensure that your entire party is present.
      </p>
      <h3>DRINK/FOOD MINIMUM</h3>
      <p>
        Although The Dream Away Lodge does not enforce a specific drink/food
        minimum in the music room, we ask that each member of your party partake
        of our offerings throughout your visit.
      </p>
      <h3>TABLE TIME LIMITS</h3>
      <p>
        The Dream Away Lodge is a small space that hosts large talent. Although
        we do not enforce a specific time limit for your visit, we ask that you
        are mindful of others&apos; opportunity to see the music. If there is a
        wait outside to attend the second set, please consider making way for
        newcomers.
      </p>
      <h3>BAND DONATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend at least a $10 (cash) contribution per person for
        the live music. Performers will be encouraged to provide QR codes for
        Venmo or other payment platform donations, to accommodate those patrons
        who prefer to pay digitally.
      </p>
      <h3>LIVE MUSIC ETIQUETTE</h3>
      <p>
        Please keep the conversation low during the performance. Most of the
        people in the room wish to hear the music.
      </p>
      <h3>COMMUNAL SEATING</h3>
      <p>
        Due to space limitations, some seating at The Dream Away Lodge is
        communal. You can expect our host to fill every available seat as the
        music begins.  If you wind up making new friends, you won’t be the
        first.
      </p>

      <h3>MINORS</h3>
      <p>
        Although The Dream Away Lodge is not a 21-and-over establishment, if you
        are bringing children, we trust that you know whether they can adapt to
        an adult environment which includes music listeners, antique knick
        knacks, and old furniture.
