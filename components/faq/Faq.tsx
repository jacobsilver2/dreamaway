      <h3>RESERVATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        LunÁtico does not accept reservations. If you are a party of three or
        more, and wish to see the live music, we recommend arriving at least 45
        minutes prior. Seats are offered on a first come-first serve basis so
        please ensure that your entire party is present.
      </p>
      <h3>DRINK/FOOD MINIMUM</h3>
      <p>
        Although LunÁtico does not enforce a specific drink/food minimum, we ask
        that each member of your party partake of our offerings throughout your
        visit.
      </p>
      <h3>TABLE TIME LIMITS</h3>
      <p>
        LunÁtico is a small space that hosts large talent. Although we do not
        enforce a specific time limit for your visit, we ask that you are
        mindful of others&apos; opportunity to see the music. If there is a wait
        outside to attend the second set, please consider making way for
        newcomers.
      </p>
      <h3>BAND DONATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend at least a $10 (cash) contribution per person for
        the live music.
      </p>
      <h3>LIVE MUSIC ETIQUETTE</h3>
      <p>
        Please keep the conversation to a whisper during the performance. Most
        of the people in the room wish to hear the music. Speaking at full
        volume impedes the transcendence of others.
      </p>
      <h3>COMMUNAL SEATING</h3>
      <p>
        Due to space limitations, some seating at LunÁtico is communal. You can
        expect our host to fill every available seat as the music begins. If you
        wind up making new friends, you won’t be the first.
      </p>
      <h3>OPENING TABS</h3>
      <p>
        We kindly request a credit card to open your tab upon ordering. This is
        due to the oft-played game of &quot;musical chairs&quot; during the live
        music. When closing your check, you may still pay by cash if you wish.
      </p>
      <h3>ORDERING AT THE BAR</h3>
      <p>
        During our busier hours, our bartenders do not take orders. Please place
        your order with your server.
      </p>
      <h3>PETS</h3>
      <p>
        Animals, including emotional support animals, are not permitted as per
        the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. The Americans
        With Disabilities Act does allow us to permit service animals which
        include any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal trained to provide
        assistance to an individual with a disability.
      </p>
      <h3>MINORS</h3>
      <p>
        Although LunÁtico is not a 21-and-over establishment, if you are
        bringing children, we trust that you know whether they can adapt to an
        adult environment which includes music listeners, antique knick knacks,
        and old furniture.
      </p>
      <h3>BACK PATIO</h3>
      <p>
        Our back patio closes promptly at 8:45pm out of respect to our neighbors
        during the live music. We do not seat parties on the back patio after
        7:45pm.
      </p>
      <h3>LAPTOPS</h3>
      <p>Laptops are permitted during Happy Hour only.</p>
      <h3>LARGE PARTIES</h3>
      <p>
        Parties of five or more are subject to a 20% automatic service charge.
      </p>
      <h3>FOREIGN GUESTS</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome! It is customary to leave a gratuity when patronizing
        restaurants and bars in the United States. The common standard is 18% -
        20% of your total bill (pre-tax).
